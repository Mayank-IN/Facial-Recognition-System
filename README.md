# Facial-Recognition-System
This is not Advance level of face Recognition. Simply collecting the data and save them in numpy array. Using Classifier HaarCascade & KNN Algorithm recognize the face.

HaarCascade
===========
Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection. This method was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features .Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. 
Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify.
Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour)
=========================
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.

OpenCV
======
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez.
It is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more. It supports multiple languages including python, java C++.
